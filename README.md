# brianTumorDetectWatershed
Determination of the brain tumor using image segementation
This is a matlab a project which is relatable to our academic signal processing course. Our target is to determine the brain tumor using the Watershed method, Levelset method and the Threshold method
# Description of the file :
# brainTumorDetect5 - 
In this file you will select a brain tumor image and a masking image at a time and determine the evolution of this project
# testFolder2:
In this file you can measure the average evolution of this project
# brainTwoDetectFunc_Two:
This is a function which is applicable in testFolder2
# The images file that we have used to evaluate this project is uploaded in this drive :
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oW67B769h6O2TukoFsGltzT3Ydr2vg-B?usp=drive_link
(You can download images from different source and use it to determine the brain tumor.It is not mandotory use our images.If you checkout the file and folder name which is used in this project code)
